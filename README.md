🧩 Phase 1: Core Features Breakdown
🔹 1. Roleplay Chat Interface
Simulates a fan–chatter messaging environment (text bubbles)

Chatter types into a real-time input box

Fan “responds” with pre-scripted or AI-generated replies

🔹 2. Scenario Modules
Each module has 3–5 preset conversation paths:

Example: “The Cheap Fan” → says “I don’t spend on messages”

Example: “The Dirty Talk Tease” → asks for a sample, tries to push limits

User picks a scenario to begin

🔹 3. Branching Logic
Depending on the chatter’s response, the fan “reacts” differently

Simple if/else logic or GPT-based responses for advanced variation

🔹 4. Scoring/Feedback
Immediate feedback after each exchange or at the end
